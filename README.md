# What does this do?
This application downloads the newest `TCP Gecko Installer` and `JGecko U` for you. It also places the files in their respective folders in the same directory as this application.

# Sounds pointless, why did you make this?
Because on the one hand, people can't read setup guides. Also it's a more convenient way than going to different places for the files. It might be extended in the future if it makes sense.

# Alright, where do I download the application?
[Here](Gecko%20U%20Updater.jar?raw=true).
